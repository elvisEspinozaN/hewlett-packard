# Hewlett Packard Enterprise Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program

Welcome to my repository for the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program! In this program, I am learning how to design and build a RESTful web service using Java Spring Boot and the GreenLake cloud platform.

Throughout this program, I am learning how to create a RESTful web service using Java Spring Boot, how to add application support for uploading data, and how to create unit tests. The HPE team has provided me with model answers to compare my work with, which helps me learn and improve my skills.

By participating in this program, I have the opportunity to discover a career in software engineering and potentially even work for HPE in the future. I am excited to learn new skills and gain practical experience from this virtual experience program.
